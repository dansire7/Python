1.  In this classs we have we have downloaded and installed anaconda
    link: https://www.anaconda.com/download

2.  We have installed python extension in VS Code.

3.  We have used python prompt and typed python to run python first

4.  We have created an environment by using command in python prompt.
    for creation: conda create -n python12 python==3.12 -y
    for activation: conda activate python12

5.  We have created a file named "requirements.txt" and typed all libraries that were required.i.e.
    numpy
    pandas
    jupyter
    mypy

6.  After creating the requirement file, we have used python prompt to install required libraries and typed:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

7.  After installation, we have come to VScode and update the environment as python12 and kernel as python12 for notebook.

8.  Notebook does not verify the variable type however the .py format identify and generate error if value is not same type. further pythond does not analyze to itself the type of variable you have to mention it every time.

10. In order to check the error in code you can type "mypy class1.py" and this will show all errors in codes.

11. Data types
    str : "Ali"
    Int : 12
    float : 10.6
    bool : True or False
    list [str]: ["ali", "saleem", "shahbaz"] string will be default type you cannot update any other type in it.
