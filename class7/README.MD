Class 7: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0K3m7ZAUnI

In this class we are understing followings.

1. Dictionary: 
    * Dictionary is datatype like list and typed as Dict[] = {values}
    * You have to import it from "typing"
    * Values will be stored in curly brackets {}
    * It consist of key and values instead of index and values
    * You can assign values in keys and extract the values through keys.
    * key and values are entered just like an object xml file.
    * Good practice is you should use custom types for keys and values or else you may face error for unhashable data types or no control over data types incase if we use "Any" data type.
    * you cannot use un-hashable values in keys but can be updated in values

2. set:
    * set is data type can be typed as set = {values}.
    * It sorts the values in ascending order and remove duplicate values.
    * you cannot print the values through index as this unhashable datatype.

3. In directory double underscore "__" method will not be used as these are system classes.

4. In Dictionary keys you cannot update, dictionary, tuples & sets however same can be added in values.

5. In case if you want to print any key value you don't it's available in dictionary than you can use "abc.get()" method and this remove the error in compiler.

6. We have understood the pprint.pprint() to view the pretty print of any dictionary.

7. We have understood how the extract keys, values and key with values as tuples with the help of loop (for and in method) or other methods ".keys()", ".values()" and ".item()".

8. We have understood how you can shuffle the values in variables.

9. We have understood how multiple keys can be added in dictionary through method ".fromkey()".
