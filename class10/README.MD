# Functions

class10: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iztf55Cs4pw

we have understand following concept in class10

1. There are pre defined functions and user defined functions.
2. Few functions returns the value and can be assigned in any variable
3. Few functions does not return value which means results cannot be assigned in any variable.
4. If any function called by using it as "func_name()" is called function.
5. If any function called by using it as "var_name.func_name()" is called method.
6. Function syntax is "def func_name (param1 : type, param2: type ...) -> return type.
7. Non return function example is "print(var)"
8. Return function example is len(var).
9. Function created with optional arguments.
10. Lambda functions are ;
    * One line function
    * without name function
    * Can be used in required line only (not re-usable).
11. Generator Function
        * iterate on element one by one
        * stop after each iteration
        * remember old iteration value (last iterate value)
        * next iterate
        * go farward from last iterate value
12. Decorator Function
        * This is the function where you have to pass another function it acts just like call back function in javascript.
13. Recursive Function
        *  This function which call itself in function body untill it's condition will be fullfilled.
